# RSS AI News Scraping Fix Documentation

## Issues Identified

1. **URLs Not Working**: RSS feed URLs returned by the content scraper MCP have incorrect dates (showing 2025 instead of 2024), making them inaccessible
2. **RSS Feeds Not Working Right Away**: The agent doesn't always parse the JSON response correctly to extract URLs
3. **Default Sources Not Always Used**: Sometimes the agent asks for RSS feed sources instead of using the configured defaults

## Root Causes

### 1. Date Parsing Issue in RSS Scraper
The RSS scraper Python script filters articles by date but the URLs contain future dates (2025), likely due to:
- RSS feeds providing incorrect publication dates
- Date parsing errors in the feedparser library
- Timezone or date format inconsistencies

### 2. Response Processing Issue
The content scraper agent receives raw JSON data but doesn't always:
- Parse the JSON structure properly to extract the 'link' field
- Format URLs correctly in the response
- Handle the nested dictionary structure of feed results

### 3. Agent Configuration Issue
The agent instructions didn't emphasize:
- Parsing the raw JSON response data
- Extracting URLs from the correct fields
- Using default sources immediately

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Agent Instructions
Updated `content_scraper_agent` configuration to:
- Emphasize parsing raw JSON responses
- Extract URLs from the 'link' field in article objects
- Always use default sources for "AI news" requests
- Handle URL date issues proactively

### 2. RSS URL Fix Utility
Created `src/utils/rss_scraper_patch.py` with functions to:
- Fix URLs with incorrect dates (2025 â†’ 2024)
- Format RSS responses with proper URL extraction
- Handle empty or malformed feed responses

### 3. Root Agent Enhancement
Updated root agent to:
- Check RSS URLs for future dates
- Use code executor to fix broken URLs
- Verify URLs before presenting to users

## Usage Instructions

### For Agent Developers
1. The content scraper agent now knows to parse JSON responses properly
2. The root agent will automatically fix RSS URLs with wrong dates
3. Default RSS sources are always used for "AI news" requests

### For Manual Fixes
If RSS URLs still have issues, use the fix utility:

```python
from src.utils.rss_scraper_patch import fix_rss_article_urls, format_rss_response_with_urls

# Fix URLs in RSS data
fixed_data = fix_rss_article_urls(rss_json_data)

# Format response with proper URLs
formatted = format_rss_response_with_urls(fixed_data)
```

## Default RSS Sources

When users request "AI news" without specifying sources:
- TechCrunch: https://techcrunch.com/feed/
- Wired: https://www.wired.com/feed/rss
- MIT Technology Review: https://www.technologyreview.com/feed/
- Ars Technica: https://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index
- The Verge: https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml

## Testing

Run the test script to verify fixes:
```bash
python3 test_rss_fix.py
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Fix RSS Scraper Date Filter**: Modify the RSS scraper to be more lenient with date filtering
2. **Add URL Validation**: Implement URL validation in the content scraper MCP
3. **Better Error Handling**: Add retry logic for failed RSS feed fetches
4. **Cache Valid URLs**: Store working URLs to avoid repeated fixes
