---

## âœ… COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. Root Agent Prompt Overhaul âœ… DONE
**Problem**: 248 lines of prescriptive, overwhelming instructions causing cognitive overload
**Solution**: Reduced to 30 lines of principle-based, focused guidance

#### Previous Issues (FIXED):
- Cognitive overload with excessive detail
- Rigid delegation patterns  
- No fallback mechanisms
- Tool-centric rather than solution-centric

#### New Approach Implemented:
